Worst Website: http://www.dpgraph.com/ 
 
Back in the 1996 computer generated graphics were increasing in popularity and with this came an influx of poorly designed websites during the “.com boom” full of code monkeys who were hoping to strike it rich with what they believed was an easy way to make easy money by either making an all digital company or buy quickly and poorly coding a website for a company and selling it at a high price. One such website is dpgraph.com, an Australian website dedicated to making 3D graphics for whoever is willing to pay for it, the only catch is how horrendous the website looks. Once one enters the website they are bombarded with garish seizure inducing colors of poorly animated gifs. There is a wall of texts boasting the capabilities of the company’s graphics generated claiming to make graphics which go anywhere from 2D all the way up to 3D? No 4D? Guess again: 8D, and as a bonus comes with a subscription to the “Flaming Thunder” programming language. Before entering this site there should be a cautionary warning to have bleach ready for your eyes.
